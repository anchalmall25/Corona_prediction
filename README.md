# Corona_Prediction NO of Cases Using Machine Learning Algorithm

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is spreading very rapidly across the globe because of its
highly contagious nature, and is declared as a pandemic by world health organization (WHO).
Scientists are endeavoring to ascertain the drugs for its efficacious treatment. Because, till now, no
full-proof drug is available to cure this deadly disease. Therefore, identifying COVID-19 positive
people and to quarantine them, can be an effective solution to control its spread. Many machine
learning and deep learning techniques are being used quite effectively to classify positive and
negative cases. In this work, a deep transfer learning-based model is proposed to classify the
COVID-19 cases using chest X-rays or CT scan images of infected persons. The proposed model is
based on the ensembling of VGG16. Themodel can extract the importance of various influential features from the X-ray images, which are
effectively used to classify the COVID-19 cases. The performance study of the proposed model
depicts its effectiveness in terms of accuracy and precision. A comparative study has also been done
with the recently published works and it is observed the performance of the proposed model is
significantly better.
